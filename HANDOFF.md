   - Dark grey/navy with blue tint per spec
   - Enhanced depth perception

18. ✅ Ship wake effects added (Scene 4):

## Previous Session Changes (October 19-21)

### **Phase 4.5: Terrain Model Optimization (4 major tasks)**
- ✅ Brightness optimized: 60% emissive + height-based shader enhancement
- ✅ Positioning fine-tuned: Scale 10.4, dramatic "hero" framing
- ✅ Scroll animation: Smooth snow→rock morph during Scene 2 transition
- ✅ Performance optimized: Frustum culling, mipmaps, anisotropic filtering

### **Phase 4: Critical Animation Corrections (5 fixes)**
11. ✅ Cloud drift direction corrected: now RIGHT→LEFT (per reference)
12. ✅ Text panning rewritten: continuous cross-screen animation (MONTFORT exits left, divisions pan through)
13. ✅ FORT ENERGY stage: displays alone without "MONTFORT" prefix (per reference "FORT EN...")
14. ✅ Scene 2 duration: 10vh → 6vh for proper timing proportion (~15s reference)
15. ✅ Light beams: added horizontal drift (±2% sinusoidal motion for organic feel)

### **Phase 1: Text & Header (4 fixes)**
1. ✅ Fixed "FORT ENERGY" text (was showing only "ENERGY")
2. ✅ Header now visible on Scene 1 with white text (transitions to dark on scroll)
3. ✅ Logo color: white → cyan (#6194b0)
4. ✅ Text panning: simplified linear formula (words meet at center)

### **Phase 2: Light Beams & Transformations (3 fixes)**
5. ✅ Replaced horizontal scan → 6 vertical light beams
6. ✅ Added Scene 2→3 reverse transformation (rock→snow, ocean→mist at 85-100%)
7. ✅ Removed division cards from Scene 3 (per reference: they belong on Ship scene)

### **Phase 3: Timing & Visual Polish (3 fixes)**
8. ✅ Zoom timing: 1000vh → 300vh (~3s cinematic reveal)
9. ✅ Forest background: added blur(4px) for depth-of-field
10. ✅ Globe→Forest: dramatic zoom in final 10% (z: 2.75→0.5)

## Content Gap Analysis: RESOLVED

### ✅ Gaps Closed This Session

1. **Header Menu System**
   - ~~Missing environmental control panel~~ → **ADDED:** Full menu panel with DAWN/DUSK/NIGHT/SNOW/TOUR controls
   - Menu now accessible from both header and scene controls button

2. **Scene 3 "Who We Are"**
   - ~~Minimal content (1-2 paragraphs)~~ → **ENHANCED:** 4 paragraphs + statistics grid + company narrative
   - Added visual interest with key metrics (3 hubs, 4 divisions, 50+ countries, 24/7 operations)

3. **Scene 3 "What We Do"**
   - ~~Generic single paragraph~~ → **TRANSFORMED:** 4 division showcase cards with icons, descriptions, and value tags
   - Clear visual hierarchy and interactive hover states

4. **Scene 6 CSR Content**
   - ~~Generic placeholder text~~ → **ENRICHED:** Detailed initiatives across 4 key areas (Education, Conservation, Health, Employment)
   - Added compliance pillars, equality metrics, and sustainable energy focus
   - More authentic and meaningful content

5. **Visual Polish**
   - ~~Atmospheric background commented out~~ → **RESTORED:** Scene 2 background crossfade active
   - All transitions smooth and aligned with reference

## Remaining Work

**High-Impact Enhancements:**
- LOD (Level of Detail) system for 3D models
- Texture compression (KTX2/Basis Universal)
- Ambient Occlusion baking for terrain
- Local asset migration (ship image)

**Recommended Testing:**
- Visual QA against reference video on live dev server
- Mobile device performance testing (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Cross-browser compatibility check (Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Performance profiling on lower-end hardware
