# Asset Generation & Implementation Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the complete workflow for generating visual assets and implementing the scroll-driven persistent canvas architecture for the Montfort landing page.

---

## Phase 1: Asset Generation (YOUR TASK) ‚úÖ READY TO START

You have **5 detailed specification documents** that provide exact requirements for generating all scene assets:

### üìÑ Asset Specification Documents

1. **ASSET_SPEC_SCENE1_MOUNTAIN.md**
   - Scene: Hero mountain view with camera rotation
   - Assets: 4K video (20-30 sec) OR 3D model (.glb)
   - Key Features: Dark cinematic mountain, orbital camera, moving clouds
   - Deliverable: `mountain-hero-4k.mp4` or `mountain-hero.glb`

2. **ASSET_SPEC_SCENE2_ISLAND.md**
   - Scene: Maritime island transformation (destination for WebGL morph)
   - Assets: 4K image/video of rocky island in ocean
   - Key Features: Daytime skybox, animated water, compositional alignment with mountain
   - Deliverable: `island-maritime-4k.jpg` or `island-maritime-4k.mp4`

3. **ASSET_SPEC_SCENE4_SHIP.md**
   - Scene: Cargo ship traveling through stormy sky
   - Assets: TWO separate assets
     - Stormy cloudscape background (4K video, 15-20 sec loop)
     - Cargo ship sprite (1400x600px PNG with transparency)
   - Deliverables: `ship-cloudscape-4k.mp4` + `cargo-ship-sprite.png`

4. **ASSET_SPEC_SCENE5_GLOBE.md**
   - Scene: Rotating Earth from space (Europe/MENA focus)
   - Assets: Either THREE textures OR one video
     - Option A: `earth-surface-8k.jpg` (8K equirectangular) + `earth-clouds-4k.png` (with alpha) + optional normal map
     - Option B: `globe-rotation-4k.mp4` (30-40 sec rotation)
   - Deliverables: See options above

5. **ASSET_SPEC_SCENE6_FOREST.md**
   - Scene: Forest with volumetric god rays (sustainability theme)
   - Assets: 4K static image with depth of field
   - Key Features: Upward view through canopy, 5-8 visible light beams, bokeh effect
   - Deliverable: `forest-godray-4k.jpg`

### üìÅ Asset Delivery Location

All assets should be placed in:
```
C:\Users\camer\Desktop\JulesLandingPage\MONFortCult\public\assets\scenes\
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Generation Time

- **Scene 1 (Mountain)**: 4-8 hours (if 3D rendering) OR 2-4 hours (if video editing/compositing)
- **Scene 2 (Island)**: 2-4 hours
- **Scene 4 (Ship)**: 4-6 hours (cloudscape + ship sprite)
- **Scene 5 (Globe)**: 3-5 hours (texture creation) OR 4-6 hours (video rendering)
- **Scene 6 (Forest)**: 2-4 hours (photography/rendering + post-processing)

**Total**: 15-30 hours depending on approach and tools used

### üéØ Priority Order

**Recommended Generation Sequence**:
1. **Start with Scene 1 (Mountain)** - Most complex, sets the visual tone
2. **Scene 2 (Island)** - Must align compositionally with Scene 1 final frame
3. **Scene 6 (Forest)** - Simpler, can be done while testing Scenes 1-2
4. **Scene 4 (Ship)** - Two separate assets, moderately complex
5. **Scene 5 (Globe)** - Choose approach based on available tools

## Phase 2: Code Implementation (CLAUDE'S TASK) ‚è≥ PENDING ASSETS

Once assets are delivered, implementation will proceed in this order:

### Stage 1: Core Infrastructure (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Build `ScrollOrchestrator.tsx` - Pins viewport, manages 1000vh scroll
- [ ] Create `SceneCanvas.tsx` - WebGL canvas layer for 3D scenes
- [ ] Create `OverlayManager.tsx` - UI layer for text/content overlays
- [ ] Test basic pinned scroll with placeholder content

### Stage 2: Scene 1 & 2 - Mountain Morph (8-12 hours)
- [ ] Implement `MountainScene.tsx` - Video/3D model rendering with camera control

### Key Technologies
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger**: Pinning, scroll progress tracking
- **Three.js**: 3D scenes (globe, particles, optional mountain)
- **WebGL Shaders**: Custom fragment shader for mountain ‚Üí island morph
- **Lenis**: Smooth scrolling (already implemented)
- **Video Playback**: HTML5 video with scroll-linked currentTime control

### Scroll-Driven Animation Pattern
```typescript
// Example: Map scroll to video playback time
const scrollProgress = (currentScroll - sceneStart) / (sceneEnd - sceneStart)
videoElement.currentTime = scrollProgress * videoDuration

// Example: Map scroll to 3D camera rotation
const rotationAngle = scrollProgress * 30 // 30¬∞ rotation over scene
camera.rotation.y = rotationAngle * (Math.PI / 180)

// Example: Map scroll to WebGL shader morph
shaderMaterial.uniforms.morphProgress.value = clamp(scrollProgress, 0, 1)
```

## Quality Standards

### Performance Targets
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5 seconds
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS during scroll on modern hardware
- **GPU Memory**: < 500 MB total texture/video memory
- **Total Asset Size**: < 100 MB (all scenes combined)

### Visual Fidelity
- All scene transitions must be smooth crossfades (no hard cuts)
- Scroll animation must be reversible (scroll up = animation reverses)
- Text overlays must be legible over all backgrounds
- No visible seams, pops, or glitches during scene transitions

### Browser Compatibility
- **Primary**: Chrome 120+, Safari 17+, Firefox 120+, Edge 120+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 17+, Chrome Android 120+
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for older browsers (static images instead of video)

## Next Steps

### For You (Asset Generation)

1. **Choose Your Approach**:
   - Scene 1: Video or 3D model?
   - Scene 5: Texture maps or pre-rendered video?

2. **Review Specifications**:
   - Read each `ASSET_SPEC_SCENE*.md` file thoroughly
   - Note quality checklists at end of each spec
   - Understand compositional requirements (especially Scene 2 alignment)

3. **Set Up Workflow**:
   - 3D software: Blender, Cinema 4D, Houdini, etc.
   - Video editing: After Effects, Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, etc.
   - Photo editing: Photoshop, GIMP, etc.

4. **Generate Assets in Priority Order**:
   - Start with Scene 1 (mountain)
   - Test Scene 1 before moving to Scene 2
   - Scene 2 MUST align with Scene 1 final frame

5. **Deliver Assets**:
   - Place in `public/assets/scenes/` folder
   - Use exact filenames from specifications
   - Run quality checklist for each asset
   - Notify when ready for integration

### For Claude (Code Implementation)

**Waiting State**: Asset generation in progress

**Trigger to Start**: User confirms "Assets are ready" or places files in delivery folder

**First Task**: Build ScrollOrchestrator infrastructure and test with Scene 1 asset

**Incremental Integration**: Test each scene individually before moving to next

**Final Delivery**: Complete scroll-driven experience matching reference video

---

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:

‚úÖ User can scroll through entire page with viewport pinned
‚úÖ Scroll position directly controls all animations (scrub forward/backward)
‚úÖ Mountain scene rotates and morphs into island based on scroll
‚úÖ Ship moves diagonally across stormy sky based on scroll
‚úÖ All text overlays fade in/out at correct scroll positions
‚úÖ Scene transitions are smooth crossfades (no hard cuts)
‚úÖ Performance maintains 60 FPS on modern hardware
‚úÖ Experience matches the visual breakdown document expectations
‚úÖ Build completes with no errors

## Contact Points

**Questions During Asset Generation?**
- Refer to quality checklists in each spec document
- Check reference materials section for visual guidance
- Ask for clarification on any ambiguous requirements

**Asset Review Before Full Implementation?**
- Submit Scene 1 first for approval
- Get feedback before generating remaining scenes
- Iterate on quality/style before bulk generation

**Ready to Proceed?**
- Confirm: "Assets for Scene X are ready for integration"
- Claude will begin implementation on that scene
- Incremental delivery is acceptable (don't wait for all assets)

---

## Estimated Total Timeline

**Best Case** (parallel work + efficient workflow):
- Asset Generation: 15-20 hours (you)
- Code Implementation: 35-40 hours (Claude, after assets ready)
- **Total**: 50-60 hours

**Realistic Case** (sequential work + iterations):
- Asset Generation: 25-30 hours (you, with revisions)
- Code Implementation: 40-45 hours (Claude, with testing/refinement)
- **Total**: 65-75 hours

**Conservative Case** (learning curve + quality iterations):
- Asset Generation: 30-40 hours (you)
- Code Implementation: 45-50 hours (Claude)
- **Total**: 75-90 hours

---

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Asset Generation Ready ‚úÖ

All specification documents are complete. You have everything needed to begin generating visual assets.

**Recommended**: Start with Scene 1 (Mountain) and deliver it for integration testing before generating the remaining scenes. This allows for early feedback on visual quality and technical approach.

**When you're ready**: Place `mountain-hero-4k.mp4` (or `.glb`) in the delivery folder and notify for integration to begin.
