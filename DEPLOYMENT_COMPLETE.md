## 🔗 Next Steps: Configure Custom Domain

### Step 1: Add DNS Records at royaltyrepair.org

You need to add a CNAME record at your domain provider (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.):

**CNAME Record:**
```
Name: mon
Value: cname.vercel.com
TTL: 3600 (or your provider's default)
```

**Important:** The record should be:
- `mon` → `cname.vercel.com` (NOT pointing to the long Vercel URL)

### Step 2: Link Domain to Vercel Project

Once DNS is configured (wait 10-30 minutes for propagation), run:

```bash
vercel domains add mon.royaltyrepair.org
```

Or add it via the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select "montfort-landing" project
3. Go to Settings → Domains
4. Add "mon.royaltyrepair.org"
5. Wait for DNS verification

### Step 3: Verify DNS Configuration

To check if DNS is set up correctly:

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
nslookup mon.royaltyrepair.org

# Should eventually show it resolves to cname.vercel.com
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment ✅
- [x] Vercel project created
- [x] `.vercel/project.json` generated
- [x] `vercel.json` configured correctly
- [x] `.vercelignore` created (excludes large media)
- [x] Production build tested locally
- [x] Git commits pushed to main branch

### Deployment ✅
- [x] Production deployment successful
- [x] Deployment URL accessible

## 🚨 Known Issues & Notes

### 1. Large Media Files
The following have been added to `.vercelignore`:
- Video files (*.mp4, *.mov, *.avi)
- High-resolution PNG images
- Development documentation

**This is normal** - Vercel has a 100MB limit. These files can be served from a CDN if needed.

### 2. Custom Domain
The domain `mon.royaltyrepair.org` was added to the project but requires DNS verification:
- You must own or have admin access to `royaltyrepair.org` DNS settings
- Add the CNAME record as shown in Step 1 above
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### 3. Free Tier Limitations
- Single region deployment (iad1 - US East)
- No multi-region support
- No Serverless Functions with multiple regions

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Current Status
| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **First Load JS** | <300KB | 337KB ⚠️ |
| **Route Size** | <200KB | 186KB ✅ |
| **Build Time** | <2min | ~45sec ✅ |
| **Deployment Speed** | <5min | ~3min ✅ |

**Note:** First Load JS is slightly over target due to Three.js library. This is normal and acceptable for 3D graphics applications.
