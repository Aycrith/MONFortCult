Comprehensive, Verbose Breakdown of the COMPLETE Visual Presentation

This report will guide the agent frame-by-frame through the entire required sequence, starting from what is currently built and detailing everything that is missing.
Scene 1: The Hero & Initial Scroll (Timestamp: 00:00 - 00:11)

(This is the part the agent has partially built. This description validates the correct parts and details the missing elements.)

    Initial State (On Load):

        Canvas Layer (Background): A full-screen, photorealistic, animated scene of a bright, misty, snow-covered mountain (the "Day" version from the target MP4). Low-lying clouds drift slowly from right to left.

        UI Layer (Foreground):

            Header: Light grey text on a transparent background. "MONTFORT GROUP" is underlined in blue.

            Center: A cyan geometric logo and the word "MONTFORT" in large, widely-spaced blue letters.

            Bottom Left: "SCROLL DOWN TO DISCOVER" in small text.

    User Action: Begins Scrolling Down

        Canvas Animation:

            Thin, vertical, ethereal light beams animate from the top of the screen downwards, as if scanning the mountain.

            The entire mountain scene begins a smooth 3D rotation, linked to the scroll position. The camera perspective shifts, giving the mountain a tangible, 3D quality.

        UI Animation:

            The text "MONTFORT" pans left as "TRADING" pans in from the right.

            As scrolling continues, "TRADING" pans left as "CAPITAL" pans in.

            As scrolling continues, "CAPITAL" pans left as "MARITIME" pans in.

Instruction for Agent: You have built a version of this with a dark background. The target video begins with a light background. However, the core scroll-text-split mechanic is correct. DO NOT STOP HERE. This is only the beginning.
Scene 2: The Scenery Morph to "Maritime" (Timestamp: 00:12 - 00:18) - MISSING CONTENT

(This is the first major piece of missing functionality.)

    Trigger: This sequence is the climax of the initial scroll and should occur as the text "MONTFORT MARITIME" is centered on the screen.

    Layer-by-Layer Breakdown of the Morph Animation (all happen simultaneously):

        Canvas Layer (Background):

            Texture Morph: The white "snow" texture on the 3D mountain model must perform a smooth crossfade/dissolve effect, revealing a rugged, green-and-brown "rocky island" texture underneath.

            Environment Morph: The thick, white mist at the base of the mountain animates downwards and simultaneously fades its opacity, seamlessly transforming into a deep blue, realistic ocean surface.

            Water Animation: The newly revealed ocean must have gentle, continuous, realistic wave animations and should reflect the island and the sky. Small rocks should appear scattered in the water around the main island.

            Skybox Morph: The bright, misty skybox transitions to a slightly clearer but still overcast sky, appropriate for a marine environment.

        UI Layer (Foreground):

            Logo Morph: The cyan geometric logo (from Scene 1) must fade out.

            New Logo: A new, white, wave-themed logo in a shield shape must fade in to the left of the "MONTFORT MARITIME" text.

Scene 3: Transition to Informational Text (Timestamp: 00:18 - 00:38) - MISSING CONTENT

    Trigger: User continues to scroll down past the "Maritime" island view.

    Visual Sequence:

        Canvas Re-Morph: The "Maritime" island scene must perform the reverse animation of Scene 2. The island smoothly crossfades back into the snowy mountain, and the ocean transforms back into mist. This returns the user to the familiar misty mountain canvas.

        Content Fade-In (Over Canvas): The "MONTFORT IS A GLOBAL COMMODITY..." headline and its sub-paragraph must fade in, centered over the misty mountain background.

        Content Transition: As the user continues scrolling, the "Who We Are" text fades out, and the "WE PROVIDE ENERGY SOLUTIONS..." headline and its paragraph fade in, still layered on top of the persistent misty mountain canvas.

Scene 4: The Cinematic Ship Sequence (Timestamp: 00:38 - 00:50) - MISSING CONTENT

    Trigger: User scrolls past the "What We Do" text block.

    Layer-by-Layer Breakdown:

        Canvas Layer (Background):

            Transition: The bright, misty mountain canvas must crossfade into a much darker, moodier, and more dramatic canvas filled with thick, grey, moving clouds. The atmosphere shifts from serene to powerful.

            Ship Animation: A large, photorealistic cargo ship animates into view from the top-right, traveling diagonally towards the bottom-left. Its movement is perfectly synchronized with the user's scroll progress.

        UI Layer (Foreground):

            Sequential Text: A series of text blocks fades in and out, timed to the scroll position as the ship passes across the screen. Each block includes a division title (e.g., "Montfort Trading") and a tagline (e.g., "OPERATING EFFICIENTLY..."). This happens for all four divisions.

        Exit Transition: As the user scrolls past the final tagline, the ship animates to fade into the dense clouds at the bottom of the viewport, and the entire cloud canvas fades out.

(Scenes 5, 6, 7 and beyond follow the same pattern as detailed in the previous comprehensive report, covering the Globe, the Forest, and the Footer. They are all currently missing and must be built sequentially after Scene 4 is complete.)
Corrective Action Plan for the Agent:

    Restore the Full Page Structure: Re-implement the code for all the missing content sections (informational text, Globe, Forest, Footer) so they exist on the page below the hero section.

    Adopt a "Scroll-Based Timeline" Model: Treat the entire landing page as a single container. Use the scroll position (e.g., scrollTop) as the primary variable to control which "Scene" is active and the progress of animations within that scene.

    Implement Scene 2 (The Morph): Focus on the texture and environment crossfade of the mountain-to-island canvas, triggered at the correct scroll depth.

    Implement Scene 3 (Informational Text): Ensure this text appears over the misty mountain background, not on a white page.

    Implement Scene 4 (The Ship): Build the dark cloud canvas and link the ship's diagonal movement directly to the scrollbar.

    Continue Sequentially: Proceed to build the Globe, Forest, and Footer scenes, ensuring smooth, animated transitions between each one. Never remove the animated canvas unless the design explicitly calls for a solid background (like the final footer).
