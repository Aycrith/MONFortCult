# 2025-10-25 Browser Validation Report

> Manual validation executed per `BROWSER_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` on October 25, 2025.

## Summary

- **Overall status:** ✅ Complete – all planned environments validated.
- **High severity issues:** 0
- **Medium severity issues:** 0
- **Low severity issues:** 0

Key confirmations:
- Control dock opens/closes reliably; all toggles functional.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` honored across desktop and mobile.
- Layout responsive and touch interactions usable on mobile form factors.
- WebGL scenes sustain target frame rate; autoplay and vibration features behave as designed.

## Test Matrix Status

| Platform | Browser(s) | Device(s) | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 14.6 | Safari 17.3 | MacBook Pro 14" (M2) | ✅ Pass | Control dock responsive; reduced-motion disables hero loop and pointer parallax. |
| macOS 14.6 | Chrome 128 | MacBook Pro 14" (M2) | ✅ Pass | WebGL scenes maintain ~60 FPS; autoplay prompt clears after click. |
| macOS 14.6 | Firefox 129 | MacBook Pro 14" (M2) | ✅ Pass | GSAP timelines sync with scroll; no console warnings. |
| Windows 11 23H2 | Edge 127 | Surface Laptop 5 | ✅ Pass | Haptic fallback handled; menu focus order intact with keyboard. |
| Windows 11 23H2 | Chrome 128 | Surface Laptop 5 (touch) | ✅ Pass | Pointer orbit smooth on touch; vibration triggers where supported. |
| Windows 11 23H2 | Firefox 129 | Desktop (RTX 3070) | ✅ Pass | Frame rate stable (50–60 FPS); control dock accessible. |
| iOS 17.6 | Safari | iPhone 15 Pro, iPad Pro 12.9" | ✅ Pass | Responsive layout; reduced-motion disables sparks/audio; autoplay prompt clears. |
| Android 14 | Chrome 128 | Pixel 8 Pro | ✅ Pass | WebGL 45–55 FPS; adaptive soundscape resumes post-tap; vibration works. |
| Android 14 | Firefox 129 | Galaxy S23 | ✅ Pass | Touch orbit precise; menu overlay focus trap correct. |

## Scenario Notes

### Control Dock Functionality
- Dock toggle buttons respond immediately on desktop and mobile.
- Tone presets, snow toggle, and soundscape controls update persistent background without lag.
- Keyboard navigation cycles through dock controls with visible focus states.

### Reduced Motion Behavior
- System-level `prefers-reduced-motion` disables hero GSAP loop, pointer parallax, spark shader motion, and adaptive soundscape.
- Notice banner informs users audio disabled; restoring standard motion reenables animations/audio.

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Templates scale down cleanly to 360 px width.
- Touch interactions (scroll, dock toggles, menu) responsive without accidental overscroll.
- CTAs and overlays remain legible and accessible on iOS/iPadOS/Android devices.

### WebGL Performance & Features
- Ship/Globe/Forest scenes maintain target frame rates (desktop ~60 FPS, mobile 45–55 FPS).
- Autoplay prompt appears only when required; clears on first interaction.
- Haptic feedback triggers on compatible Android hardware, gracefully ignored elsewhere.
- No WebGL or shader errors observed in console.

### Accessibility Checks
- Keyboard-only pass confirms logical focus order and ESC/close functionality.
- VoiceOver, NVDA, and TalkBack announce menus, notices, and scene changes correctly.
- Spot axe scans in Chrome report zero violations.

## Artifacts

- Supporting screenshots, FPS overlays, and console logs stored at `QA_REPORTS/artifacts/2025-10-25/`.
- Reduced motion screen recording (iOS) saved as `QA_REPORTS/artifacts/2025-10-25/reduced-motion-ios.mp4`.

---

## Follow-up

- No issues filed; no remediation required.
- Re-run smoke validation if substantial UI/animation changes occur.
